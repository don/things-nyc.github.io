  Description: >
    This project encompasses building the organization and spreading the word about TTN,
    Open IoT Infrastructure, LoRa, and what the group has to offer. This includes for the
    most part the myriad networking, note-taking, meetings, and organization work
    that Terry engages in. Also, creating and maintaining our website, Wiki, and Blog.
  Status: Ongoing
  Nextsteps: >
    Better presentation of collaborative opportunities. More in-person hands-on
    make-it-work workshops. Fund raising. T-shirts & stickers.

- Title: Gateway fleet management system
  Lead: jeffhonig
  Contributors: terrymoore
  Description: >
    A system supporting the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of a fleet of Multitech
    Conduit and Conduit AP gateways.  As part of deploying hundreds of gateways to cover
    NYC and Ithaca regions of New York State, the group plans to offer management of those
    gateways as a service to gateway owners.  The system uses the Ansible Configuration
    Management tool to drive gateway configuration, an SSH jumphost to enable secure remote
    access and a monitoring tool to send alerts on gateway status changes.
  Status: Active Development, being used to deploy gateways
  Nextsteps: Improve robustness, continuous integration testing

- Title: Arduino LMiC Library Forks
  Lead: terrymoore
  Contributors: frankleonrose
  Description: >
    The LMiC (LoRa-Mac in C) library came from IBM and is hosted here: https://github.com/matthijskooijman/arduino-lmic .
    When the team at TTN-NY first started building Arduino nodes, they discovered many missing features related to
    operating within the US band plan. Frank made an effort to submit merge requests back upstream but Matthijs has
    been slow to respond. Recent changes have not been converted to PRs. Terry forked the things-nyc repo and made
    even more extensive changes to support his Catena boards, including adding all global band plans.
  Status: The MCCI-Catena fork is our recommended building block for Arduino development with the 1276/8 chips (RFM-95).
  Nextsteps: Document superiority of MCCI-Catena fork so that people use it first

- Title: Manhattan Borough TTN Coverage Mapper
  Lead: mimiflynn
  Contributors: frankleonrose
  Description: >
    The Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer, is a vocal advocate for building Smart City infrastructure
    in an open way that encourages innovation. TTN-NY is building LoRa node with GPS that will be installed
    in Gale’s primary vehicle. The node will send regular packets containing the car’s location to a mapping
    server. Gale will thereby be actively participating in the development of a TTN coverage map as she conducts
    her business around the city.
  Status: Prototyping
  Nextsteps: Install in MBP’s car
  Repositories: None

  Description: >
    As part of the Harlem Heat Project, Brian has deployed a number of off-the-shelf sensors to measure indoor
    temperatures in the city. He would like to collect data from the sensors via TTN. However, he would like
    to avoid having to visit the sensors to replace batteries every two weeks. Terry provided Brian with some
    Catena-based sensors, but their power consumption is too fast. Frank and Forrest figured out the protocol
    for communicating with the existing off-the-shelf temperature sensors. Now Frank is putting together a
    communications board that will be able to send out readings via LoRa. In order to conserve battery, the
    communications board has a timer based startup circuit that periodically wakes it up.
  Status: Prototyping power management
  Nextsteps: Deploy and test battery longevity

- Title: ISeeChange remote measurements
  Lead: Brian Vant-Hull (https://www.noaacrest.org//about/our-people/detail/brian-vant-hull)

  Description: >
    ISeeChange uses off-the-shelf high quality environmental sensors. The sensor manufacturer offers a
    cellular-based remote logging solution that is more expensive than this not-for-profit can afford.
    TTN-NY offered to build a LoRa based communications board for the sensor. ISeeChange uses the next
    generation of sensor which has replaced serial communication with a USB-wrapped-serial system.
    The main challenge in getting this to work is to build a low power board that acts as a USB host.
  Status: Prototyping
  Nextsteps: Build USB host that talks to USB serial sensor board.

- Title: MapTheThings
  Lead: frankleonrose
  Contributors: forrestfiller
  Description: >
    TTN Mapper (http://ttnmapper.org/) is the standard mapping service used by 1500 TTN users globally.
    Frank created the MapTheThings (http://map.thethings.nyc) service as a fully open source alternative
    with scalability as a primary goal. Specifically, the service summarizes successful and attempted
    transmissions into a multi-scale geo-hashed grid so that displaying data for any region on the globe
    requires a (roughly) constant and relatively small volume of data downloaded. The server is deployed
    on Heroku with SQS buffering and summary data is served directly from S3. On the node side,
    MapTheThings pairs a bluetooth and LoRa enabled node with an iOS app that tracks location and
    drives transmission of packets. A GPS-equipped LoRa node can also send location packets, but in
    this use case there is no tracking of attempted transmissions.
  Status: Operational.
  Nextsteps: Do more LoRa walking. Data re-processing tools. Improve scalability (Lambda + merging infrastructure like Kinesis or MR). Data slicing features.
